A collection of bash shell scripts for automating various tasks with [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) using the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)

# Introduction

Over the years, I've written a set of utility scripts to automate some of the repetitive and mundane tasks on AWS, thereby avoiding clicks through the AWS web console.  These scripts follow the theme of being simple and requiring only the `jq` utility.

# Usage

These scripts assume the user has the `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable set.

# Other Projects

This project is highly opinionated.  You may find the following projects more flexible, expansive:
